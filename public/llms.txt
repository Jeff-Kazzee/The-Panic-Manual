# The Panic Manual

> Free guides and AI prompts helping people understand and fight back against confusing medical bills, collection letters, and other institutional documents. No sponsors, no affiliates—just practical help.

The Panic Manual teaches people how to use AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to analyze complex financial documents, find errors in medical bills, understand their rights in debt collection, and write effective dispute letters. Our approach combines emotional support ("The Breath") with tactical AI prompts.

## Core Philosophy

- We treat users as intelligent adults being manipulated by opaque systems
- AI is a tool to level the playing field, not a replacement for professional advice
- Always verify AI outputs—run prompts multiple times, try different LLMs
- Medical and debt systems are designed to confuse; clarity is power
